Dunlin Management Limited (DML) is committed to conducting its business in an environmentally
responsible manner that prevents pollution and promotes the preservation
of the environment. Sound environmental stewardship of the Dunlin
facilities is a key consideration and, together with industry
regulators, we aim to consider and consult widely on the most
appropriate environmental management measures to be applied.

Our Environmental Management System (EMS) is designed to match the elements of
the relevant guidance from the Competent Authority and fulfil the
requirements of Oslo Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention)
recommendation 2003/5. In its transition to
becoming an operator on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, DML has committed to commission an
independent external verification of its EMS by an appropriately
accredited certification body at the earliest credible opportunity.

We will also publish an annual statement of environmental performance in
accordance with the OSPAR Convention.
