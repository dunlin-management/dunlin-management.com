Dunlin Management Limited (DML) is committed to maintaining the highest standards of health and
safety compliance and performance as it approaches the unique challenges
associated with the long term management of decommissioned facilities.
Our Health & Safety Policy Statement outlines our robust approach to
health and safety, with the management of risk an important part of
corporate governance.

Our principal health and safety objectives are to ensure a working
environment for our employees and contract personnel that meets
internationally recognised standards of health and safety, and to ensure
that the health and safety risks to others that may be affected by our
business activities are as low as reasonably practicable.

The remaining Dunlin facilities operate according to a documented and approved Safety
Case with ongoing inspection by the Health
& Safety Executive. The Safety Case outlines the residual risks
associated with those facilities and how the DML organisation is
structured to manage those risks responsibly over the long term.
