DML demands and maintains the highest professional standards in relation
to business conduct.  The principle of good governance underpins our
business activities and influences our ability to act in a manner that
is not only legally compliant but is ethical and responsible. DML's Code
of Business Ethics supports our commitment to corporate responsibility.

As a UK company, we are bound by the UK's Bribery Act 2010 and Criminal
Finances Act 2017 in respect of our business conduct both in the UK and
overseas.  We operate a strict "zero tolerance" policy towards bribery,
corruption and tax evasion in business.  Bribery, corruption and tax
evasion are not only criminal offences but are unethical and entirely
contrary to our core values.

Our Code of Business Ethics reinforces that all officers and employees
of Dunlin Management Limited must comply with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations where they operate, international standards and rules,
and all internal corporate rules and policies. In addition, all officers
and employees of the company must act in a socially responsible manner
by complying with the highest ethical standards in the conduct of their
business.
