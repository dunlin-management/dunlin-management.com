Dunlin Management Limited (DML) is committed to conducting business in compliance with the Modern
Slavery Act 2015, ensuring Modern Slavery is not taking place in any
part of our business or supply chain.

DML is committed to recognising the potential risks and putting in place
the necessary steps to combat all forms of 'Modern Slavery', defined as
slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking,
in either our own business or that of our supply chain in line with
section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We recognise our
responsibility to take a robust approach to preventing modern slavery in
our corporate activities that includes ensuring that our supply chain is
free from any form of modern slavery.
