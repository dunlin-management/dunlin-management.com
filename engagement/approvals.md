The [Draft Decommissioning Programme](/assets/Dunlin-Alpha-Decom-Programme-Rev-A6-2nd-version-FBL-DUN-DUNA-HSE-01-PLN-00001.pdf) issued in 2018 originally covered
both the topsides and the substructure and was accompanied by two key
supporting documents: a [Comparative Assessment Report](/assets/Dunlin-Alpha-Comparative-Assessment-Report-A-301649-S07-REPT-005.pdf) and an
[Environmental Appraisal](/assets/Dunlin-Alpha-Environmental-Appraisal-Report-XOD-DUN-HSE-RPT-00005.pdf). However, since that time the two programmes
have been separated. The now-approved Final Dunlin Alpha Topsides
Decommissioning Programme and associated Topsides Environmental
Appraisal both take this separation into account.

Documentation relating to the substructure currently comprises the
Dunlin Alpha Substructure Comparative Assessment Report (March 2021) and
the Substructure Environmental Appraisal (September 2021). These take
account of refinements made following stakeholder and regulatory
comments from the 2018 consultation, as well as reflecting the
additional, extensive investigative work into the storage cells which
has been undertaken.

The substructure decommissioning programme will be finalised after
consultation with the international community on a derogation
application to leave the CGBS in place under the terms of [OSPAR
Convention Decision 98/3](https://www.ospar.org/documents?v=6875) on
the Disposal of Disused Offshore Installations. This allows for
exceptions to be made from the normal requirement for full removal, such
as concrete installations like Dunlin Alpha.

The final decommissioning programme submitted for approval to the UK
government will take account of the continuing engagement and additional
work undertaken since the original statutory and public consultation in
2018.
