The development of the Dunlin Alpha platform decommissioning plans has
been underpinned by a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement.
This has enabled stakeholder views and expertise to be fully
incorporated, allowing potential impacts to be thoroughly explored and
addressed at every stage of the planning process. These activities are
described in a dedicated [Stakeholder Engagement Report (April 2024)](/assets/Dunlin-Alpha-Stakeholder-Engagement-Report-for-consultation.pdf)
which covers both the platform topsides and the concrete gravity base
substructure (CGBS) of the Dunlin Alpha installation.
