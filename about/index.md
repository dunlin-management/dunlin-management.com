Dunlin Management Limited (DML) is an operating company formed in 2024
charged with managing the remaining decommissioning activities in the
Greater Dunlin Area of the Northern North Sea. The Greater Dunlin Area
achieved Maximum Economic Recovery in 2015 and Cessation of Production
(COP) occurred in June of that year.

Building on the success of the former operator, Fairfield Energy
Limited, in its execution of the initial decommissioning programmes for
the Dunlin, Dunlin South West, Osprey and Merlin oil fields, DML is
responsible for completion of any emergent decommissioning scopes and
management of the residual facilities over the long term.

DML is a UK-registered, wholly-owned, subsidiary of Mitsubishi
Corporation who are the owners of the remaining facilities in the above
fields. DML has been appointed OSD well and OSD installation operator in 2024
under Regulation 5 of the Offshore Petroleum Licensing (Offshore Safety
Directive) Regulations 2015. DML has been granted
the necessary authority to deliver its safety and environmental duties
and responsibilities in relation to the above fields and has the
capacity to meet those requirements now and into the future.
