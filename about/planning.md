The overall decommissioning project, from Cessation of Production (COP) to
final site remediation, is a multi-year undertaking. Throughout each of
the main project stages, the associated activities have been planned in
consultation with relevant stakeholders. These stakeholders
include industry regulators and other users of the marine environment.

Consultation on the decommissioning of the Greater Dunlin Area commenced
in 2010 and those discussions on specific aspects of the decommissioning
proposals have been the backdrop for a collaborative process to
determine the most appropriate solutions for the decommissioning
challenges that balance considerations for the environment, safety,
technical feasibility, and socio-economic impact.

The overall decommissioning scope has been captured in a total of six
decommissioning programmes -- Osprey, Merlin, Dunlin Subsea
Infrastructure, Export Pipeline, Dunlin Alpha Topsides and Dunlin Alpha
Substructure. All but the Substructure Decommissioning Programme (DP) have been approved, executed
and closed-out with the competent authority (the Offshore Petroleum
Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning). The Substructure DP is
still under consideration by the competent authority and is a key focus
for Dunlin Management Limited moving forward.
